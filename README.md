#Title: 
Analysis on Liver Disease Diagnosis and Prediction

#Background:
The liver is a vital visceral organ that plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including digestion, detoxification, regulation of blood sugar levels, and production of important proteins. Liver diseases can range from mild to life-threatening illnesses. 
Most of the common liver diseases are:
Fatty liver disease â€“ associated with excessive alcohol, diabetes and obesity
Hepatitis : inflammation caused by viruses 
Cirrhosis : advanced scarring of the liver tissue caused by long-term damage, often due to chronic alcoholism, viral hepatitis, or other factors
Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) originates in the liver cells and is often associated with underlying liver disease.
